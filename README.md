# JSON-AJAX-API
Building Testing Learning the various concepts of JSON Javascript and AJAX

**JSON**: *Javascript Object Notation*

**AJAX**: *Asynchronous JSON And XML*

**Repository** is divided into sections containing source code for various projects.

**NOTE**: I will be using [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) for 
serving the files on a live server in the browser. You can also use any other server on 
your computer like the python ```SimpleHTTPServer``` using

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
